    "feedback": "Staying at this boutique hotel was like stepping into a fairytale. The decor was charming, with antique furniture and cozy nooks. The staff was warm and welcoming, always ready to assist. The location was perfectâ€”close to the city center yet tucked away from the hustle and bustle. My only minor gripe was that the Wi-Fi signal was a bit weak in certain areas."
